Course 4 Week 1 Project 1

This repository is for the course the "exploratory data analysis" offered from Coursera Data Science specialization.  The code is for project 1 during week 1.

Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. The plots given in the
assignment have been reconstructed using the base plotting system.

For each plot, the plot has been constructed and saved to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
The plot files are named as 
plot1.png, 
plot2.png, etc.

A separate R code file has been created for each plot.  For example, 
plot1.R, 
plot2.R, etc. that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in 
plot1.R constructs the 
plot1.png plot.
